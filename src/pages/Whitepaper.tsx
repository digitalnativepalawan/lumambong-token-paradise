              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Philippine law restricts land ownership to Filipino citizens or corporations that are at least 60% Filipino-owned. 
                Halo Bloc fully complies with this by operating through an SEC-registered Philippine corporation (Halo Bloc Inc.) 
                where 60% of the shares are owned by Filipino citizens.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                <strong>Foreign investors</strong> participate economically through their up to 40% stake via HBCX tokens, which represent 
                beneficial interest in the company/project. This structure provides a <strong>legal investment route for foreigners</strong> 
                while respecting national ownership laws. 
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                We've structured HBCX to give foreign investors rights to profits <strong>without giving title to land</strong>,

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) is a well-known vehicle that also allows fractional investment in real estate. 
                However, there are key differences between a traditional REIT and Halo Bloc's tokenized project:

                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    A REIT typically owns a portfolio of properties with public ownership requirements. 
                    Halo Bloc focuses on <strong>single-project investment</strong> ‚Äì each HBCX digital asset 
                    is tied to a specific property, providing more direct exposure.

                  <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                    Tokenization is more flexible and cost-efficient. REITs involve significant fees and regulatory hurdles. 
                    By using blockchain, we automate many processes, resulting in <strong>higher net returns</strong> to investors.

                    Both REITs and HBCX tokens are regulated as securities under different frameworks. 
                    Halo Bloc operates within securities laws but offers a <strong>different, more flexible model</strong> than a REIT.

              <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4">
                Fractional ownership isn't entirely new ‚Äì groups have pooled money to co-own property before. The <strong>major legal challenge</strong> 
                in traditional setups is often the clarity and security of ownership records, and the rights of investors.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Halo Bloc improves this by using blockchain to issue tokens that incontrovertibly represent your share in the asset. 
                The tokens are effectively <strong>digital securities</strong> with all transactions recorded immutably, providing an 
                <strong>audit trail for regulators and owners alike</strong>. This addresses issues of trust and transparency that 
                plagued older fractional models, and we fall squarely under securities law with full SEC oversight.

                Under the <strong>SEC Memorandum Circular Nos. 4 and 5, Series 2025</strong>, all crypto-asset service providers 
                dealing in digital asset offerings must register and comply with strict requirements. This includes maintaining 
                minimum capital (‚Ç±100M for full CASPs), separating customer assets from company assets, and submitting regular reports.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Our <strong>end goal is full compliance</strong> ‚Äì we plan to graduate from the sandbox and meet CASP licensing standards. 
                We believe our proactive compliance gives investors confidence that we are a <strong>legally sanctioned investment</strong> 
                under active SEC oversight, not an unregulated scheme.

                While not a direct financial regulatory comparison, it's worth noting our compliance with <strong>local real estate 
                and environmental laws</strong>. Many development projects in Palawan have struggled due to non-compliance with environmental 
                rules. Halo Bloc secures all clearances upfront and works closely with agencies like PAMB, obtaining proper licenses 
                and engaging in mandated environmental protections. This compliance not only avoids legal pitfalls but aligns with 
                the <strong>ethical and sustainability expectations</strong> of modern investors.

              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Halo Bloc's model is carefully <strong>woven into the legal and regulatory fabric</strong> of the Philippines. 
                We take the best aspects of existing frameworks (investor protection and shared ownership ideas behind REITs, 
                the flexibility of fractional ownership, and the innovation allowances of the sandbox) and create a solution that is both 
                groundbreaking and compliant. Our commitment is that <strong>innovation will not come at the expense of compliance</strong>; 
                rather, we believe working within the regulatory system is the only sustainable way to introduce revolutionary 
                blockchain-based real estate investment.

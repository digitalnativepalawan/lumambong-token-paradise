          <p className="mb-6">
            The Binga Beach Tokenized Real Estate project aims to launch a marketing campaign and secure $100,000 in funding for 15% equity by August 2025, focusing on tokenized fractional ownership of 10 premium beachfront lots with solar-powered modular homes in Palawan, Philippines. This timeline integrates the use of the SEC's Regulatory Sandbox (StratBox) and a partnership with Coins.ph to facilitate tokenization, while ensuring compliance with real estate regulations. Given the current date (July 4, 2025), the timeline prioritizes preparation in July 2025 to meet the August 2025 marketing launch goal, with subsequent steps for development and deployment.
